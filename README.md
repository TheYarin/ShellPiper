## Adding to path

### Windows

For use in `cmd.exe`, put [`sp.cmd`](TODO: add link) in a directory that is in your Path and edit it so the path points to the installed exe.

### Special Thanks

I want to thank [electron-react-boilerplate](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/) for saving me a ton of drudgery and helping me focus on the fun parts.
